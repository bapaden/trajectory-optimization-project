Using the SNOPT mex Files              Philip Gill, UCSD June 14  2013
=========================           Elizabeth Wong

Run Matlab in the folder studentVersions

 Typing
  >> more on
  >> help Contents
from Matlab provides an overview of the package.

 At the Matlab prompt, type
  >> runAllExamples
This script sets the appropriate matlab path.

 The subdirectory ./examples contains various sample problems
that demonstrate how to use the snOpt Matlab interfaces.  Read
the in-line help information for each m-file for more
information.


  To run the individual m-files type

  >> setpath  % if you haven't already called runAllExamples
  >> addpath examples
  >> addpath examples/snmain
  >> snoptmain


The are three different ways to call snopt:

[x,F,INFO] = snopt(x,xlow,xupp,Flow,Fupp,'MySimplestFun');

[x,F,INFO] = snopt(x,xlow,xupp,Flow,Fupp,'MyLessSimpleFun', ...
                   A, iAfun, jAvar, iGfun, jGvar);

[x,F,xmul,Fmul,INFO]= snsolve( x,xlow,xupp,xmul,xstate,    ...
                               Flow,Fupp,Fmul,Fstate,      ...
                               ObjAdd,ObjRow,A,iAfun,jAvar,...
                               iGfun,jGvar,'MyGeneralFun');

If you provide the derivatives of your problem functions be sure to check them
first using the command:
>> snseti('Verify level', 3);


BOTTOM LINE:  The more information you give, the FASTER and MORE RELIABLE the solve.
------------ (the  LONGER THE ARGUMENT LIST, the FASTER and MORE RELIABLE the solve)
