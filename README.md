# trajectory-optimization-project
File dump from my class project. This matlab script may not work and is only for reference. The full version of SNOPT has been replaced with the academic version. If you use this as a reference for a class project, be sure that you are staying well within the boundaries laid out in the ethical guidelines for that class. Please contact me at bapaden@mit.edu if the availability of this code is problematic for your class.

The code uses a clumsy implementation of an RRT to get an initial trajectory which is then passed on to to SNOPT with a simple direct transcription of the problem with Euler's method.
